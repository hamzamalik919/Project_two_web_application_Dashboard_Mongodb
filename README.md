#Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard
#Description
A web-based tool called the Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard offers an interactive interface for viewing and analyzing data from animal shelters. It enables visitors to go through the records of the shelter's animals, filter data based on rescue scenarios, display breed-specific statistics, and locate certain animals on a map.
The Dash framework and Python were used to build the dashboard, which gives administrators and workers at the shelter an easy-to-use interface. With the dashboard, users can quickly access and examine crucial data regarding the animals in the shelter, assisting them in making decisions and increasing operational effectiveness.
#Features
•	Data from animal shelters are displayed in an interactive table with filtering options.
•	Allows users to filter the data database based on different sorts of rescue.
•	Breed statistics graph: Employs a bar graph to show the distribution of animal breeds.
•	Visualization of a map that places the locations of chosen animals on a workable map.
